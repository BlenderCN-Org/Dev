-- This test verifies the impact of the restitution in simple collision environment.
-- A grid of blocks behind shows the delimitation where balls started.
-- The ground block has a restitution of 1, while spheres vary from 0/16 to 19/16.
-- The red ball indicates a restitution of 1 (should come back as high as it started).
-- The 3 rightmost balls are in a situation where they create energy.
