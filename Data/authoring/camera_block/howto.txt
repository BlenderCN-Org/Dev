How I did the block and camera icons (tri-state)
- Made the icons with Inkscape in SVG.
   - Exported to 56x56 PNGs (or 56x50 for camera.png).
- Opened in GIMP.
   - Increased canvas size to 64x64 (centered).
   - Duplicated layer.
   - Filters -> Alpha to Logo -> Neon...
      - Width of 8 pixels.
      - Used FFDDDD for light red and D6DBFD for light blue.
      - Kept background as black.
   - Deleted black background layer.
   - Merge both neon layers.
   - Renamed layers.
   - Exported results as PNG.
